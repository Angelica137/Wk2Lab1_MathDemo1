# Numbers

- Add a generateLottoNumber() which returns a random number to play the lottery
- Write a method which accepts three integer parameters and returns the maximum of the 3 integers which have been passed to it. (Look at the methods available in the Math class). Test this method.
- Write a bestOfThree() method, which should prompt the user for 3 integers. The bestOfThree() method should then call the method you wrote for part (b) and display the result. Test the method.
